Take this number for an example : 737369261 will map to 2BF35CAD in the hexadecimal format. Notice the length doesn‚Äôt change by much, yeah but you can appreciate the aesthetics in the hex and hex (hence) the ‚Äúnot so intimidating reference I made. Now I want you to try this exercise, try memorizing both numbers. You will appreciatetge existence of the alphabet in there as it is easier to memorize. ‚Äú2bf-thirty five-card‚Äù is much simpler than 737- u already lost me friend. The best thing about the hex system is when @compare with the binary is the the brutal length reduction. Binary : 11110000000000001111101001101110 will map to F000FA6E. Wow who could have seen that ‚Äúone one one one O O O O O O O O O O O O one one one one one O one O O - please u lost me already‚Äù could be made easier for computer programmers? Well system architects did and placed a hex on itü§£ü§£ü§£. And we got ‚Äúfoofage‚Äù. Evidently Hex system reduces binary number length vigorously with impunity as a shorthand for wringing binary.
